# Design Documentation
  By Ollie Pegram
##Site audience
  The site audience is aimed at potential emplyees, also to show off my front end skills and see what I can put together with that knowledge.
##Design decisions
  + The first thing I designed was the center section of my site, which at first displayed my, but after time I put that in the navbar and just put a welcome message instead. After designing the center section I then began to get an idea of where i'm going with the design, and deciding what fonts and colours to use based on that.
  + I like to play around with borders as I think they can really add to your design, so for the about me, contact and work section I decided to play around with the borders on those using my main colour and mixing it up with white.
  + For frameworks I wanted to use something to help with grids and a bit of responsiveness so I added bootstrap early on in the project, because I added it early it was easy to put my own styles on everything to make it look like i wasnt even using a framework.
  + I have chosen only one major color as it stands out alot compared to other colors and its easy to work with white and black with it.

##Usability considerations
 
###Aesthetic and minimalist design
+ My site is very minimal, the whole top section only has a nav bar and a welcome message with clearly layed out buttons, I've managed to keep this design going throught the whole of my site, which has reduced alot of clutter and made it very easy to navigate and readable. 

###Consistency and standards
+ I have been concistent with my design throughout the site, with border being the same width and colors and fonts matching the design. For the responsive element I have been able to keep the design roughly the same but also more usable for mobile users or smaller screens.
